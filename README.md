# 🎮 Intercepter  

**Intercepter** is a browser-based interactive game project with a built-in level editor and modular architecture. Designed to be lightweight, extensible, and Replit-friendly, it allows developers and players to **play, edit, and customize** gameplay directly from the web.

## 📖 Overview  

Intercepter consists of:  
- **Game Engine (`/game`)** → Core gameplay mechanics, rendering, and player interactions.  
- **Editor (`/editor`)** → Intuitive in-browser editor for creating and modifying levels or assets.  
- **Assets (`/assets`)** → Images, audio, and resources powering the visuals and sounds.  
- **Libraries (`/libraries`)** → Third-party libraries for performance and modular features.  
- **Frontend Pages** →  
  - `index.html` → Launches the game  
  - `editor.html` → Opens the level editor
